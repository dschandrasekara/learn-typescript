/*An operator defines some function that will be performed on the data.
The data on which operators work are called operands.
Consider the following expression −
7 + 5 = 12
Here, the values 7, 5, and 12 are operands, while + and = are operators.

The major operators in TypeScript can be classified as −

compile command FILENAME=Operator  FOLDER=operators npm run compile
run command     FILENAME=Operator  FOLDER=operators npm run output
